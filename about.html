    <p>I have been interested in computer science since I was 8 years old.</p>
    <p>My first language I learnt was python. I Taught it to myself through playing with code, and trial and error.</p>
    <p>Then when I learnt the basic syntax I started making some of my own code.</p>
    <p>I then took up programming clubs at school, one of which was competitive</p>
    <p>I did some competitions, however for me I preferred programming with games.</p>
    <p>So I started some basic game hacking with cheat engine.</p>
    <p>At this time I moved to the UK so I had to learn Visual Basic for my new school</p>
    <p>As Visual Basic was quite locked, with a lack of plugins, and creativity, I learnt C#</p>
    <p>Using C# I created some basic plugins for a steam MMORPG game.</p>
    <p>I also developed a minecraft c# client that used memory hooks to edit the data</p>
