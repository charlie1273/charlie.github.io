    <p>I have been interested in computer science since I was 8 years old. My first programming language was python, and I taught myself it. My earliest project was making a hangman game in my year 5 project class. It would choose through a random list of words and then using the console, ask you to guess a letter. If the letter was right, it would replace the “-” and if it was wrong, one extra line would be added to the hangman. I then took up python as a hobby and did coding clubs for it at my school. </p>
